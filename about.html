                                <p>Living in a city like Delhi, I’ve seen countless people come here, leaving their homes in search of better opportunities. Yet, what I’ve come to understand is that for those coming from underprivileged backgrounds, the journey is not just about migration; it’s a constant battle. These individuals, who have little to no privilege, face rejection and struggle every step of the way. Whether it’s educating their children, finding stable employment, or accessing healthcare, they are met with obstacles that many of us fail to see. And while we may consider urban dwellers "privileged," I realized that even they are forced to compromise in their everyday lives, whether it's dealing with waste, living unsustainably, or sacrificing their well-being in pursuit of a better life. Two years spent in Bastar changed my perspective on what true privilege really means. In the heart of rural India, where the struggle for basic needs is real, I saw a clear contrast with urban life. We often call ourselves privileged, but the truth is, we’re just as caught in a cycle of overconsumption, waste generation, and environmental degradation. In cities like Delhi, people are trapped in a system that forces them to make compromises on every front. This realization sparked something inside me: the need to repull, to reconnect people, to create change. And thus, RIPULL Foundation was born. Our mission isn’t just about providing livelihood opportunities or addressing basic needs; it’s about empowering individuals to break free from the cycles that hold them down, to raise awareness, and to create lasting impact. We’re not just talking about change. We are working to make it a reality. By focusing on sustainable livelihoods, promoting environmental responsibility, and addressing critical issues like menstrual hygiene, we are striving to uplift those who need it the most. It’s a call for action, a call for unity, and a call to ensure that every person, regardless of their background, has the chance to thrive. Together, we can create a future that’s not just better, but truly equal for all. Join us as we work towards a more inclusive and sustainable tomorrow.</p>

                                <p>As a co-founder of our non-profit, I am deeply inspired by our founder’s vision of building a more inclusive and equitable society. Our mission is rooted in the belief that rural and semi-urban communities, especially youth and women, hold immense potential that often goes untapped due to systemic barriers. We set out to change that. Our organization champions social inclusion by creating meaningful livelihood opportunities through the lens of the circular economy. Whether it is waste management, skill development, or tech-driven interventions, our programs are designed to be sustainable, scalable, and centered around the communities we serve. We focus on equipping individuals with the tools and training they need to thrive in every aspect of life. By addressing core challenges like unemployment, lack of access to training, and environmental degradation, we are not only building resilient communities but also enabling long-term impact. Every initiative we design is aimed at promoting self-reliance, encouraging innovation, and ensuring that no one is left behind. Our work is more than a response to immediate needs. It is a commitment to systemic change. The youth and women we work with are not just beneficiaries. They are partners and changemakers in this journey. I invite you to be part of this transformation. Whether as a supporter, collaborator, or advocate, your involvement can help amplify our impact. Together, we can build a future where opportunity is not dictated by geography or background, but shaped by collective action and shared purpose. Join us as we work towards a more inclusive and sustainable tomorrow.</p>
